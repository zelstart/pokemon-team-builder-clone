## Description 
A pokémon team building application. Users can sign up, login, and create their own pokémon teams and save them in one spot. Users can choose from any of the 1117 pokémon currently available to create a team of six pokémon, customizing their moves, natures and abilities to their liking. A little bit simpler than the team builder from Pokémon Showdown, making it easier to quickly set up a new team.
